// Holds error data returned from a gRPC procedure call when an exception occurs.
//
// gRPC already supports returning of rich errors via the standard error payloads (https://google.aip.dev/193#error_model).
// However these aren't a great match for standard .NET exceptions.  ApplicationAccess already defines a mechanism for 
// serializing and deserializing .NET exceptions (including the exception stack) via the 
// ApplicationAccess.Hosting.Models.HttpErrorResponse class, which has been proven to allow reliable serialization and
// re-hydration/re-throwing of .NET exceptions.  Hence this message replicates that class.
